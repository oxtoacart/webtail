# webtail

## Objective

webtail.me allows you to tail files to the web for sharing with other people.

`webtail` is the command-line client for doing this.

## Installation

Requires [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)

`npm install -g webtail`

## Quick Start

Start tailing

    > webtail http://webtail.me/ox/ mylogfile.txt
    tailing to http://webtail.me/ox/3426f2b6
    
Point a browser or curl at that url

    > curl http://webtail.me/ox/3426f2b6
    
For HTTPS, right now you need to use https://webtail.jit.su.  We hope to support
https://webtail.me soon.

## Usage

```
Usage: webtail [--new] url_to_webtail [file_to_tail]

webtail can either be used by piping data to it:

  > tail -100lf mylogfile.txt | webtail http://webtail.me/ox/mylogfile.txt

or it can read the file directly, in which case it behaves like tail -f:

  > webtail http://webtail.me/ox/mylogfile.txt mylogfile.txt

To generate new random paths, use the --new flag:

  > webtail --new http://webtail.me/ox myfile
  tailing to http://webtail.me/ox/3426f2b6


Options:
  --new  If specified, a new random path will be created under the given
         url.
```
